<lightgrey><i>"The subset of Deno programs which are
 written completely in JavaScript and do
 not use the global `Deno` namespace, ought

- Unlike in Node, `window` is defined.
- For example, `<lightgreen>fetch</lightgreen>` just works!
- Compatibility is WIP, see: <a><href>https://deno.dev/wpt</href>deno.dev/wpt</a>
